Simple Sinhala translator (v0.1)
--------------------------------

Developed By: Dananjaya M. Perera (dananjaya01@gmail.com) (https://github.com/dzero1)

This simple application can be use to translate any text file to sinhala language.
I'm using google translater api, with batch line translating to increese the efficiency. 
If the translator gives an error because of the length of the text, you can reduce the 
"batchCount" and try again.

Usage example:
```
    Python3 translate_to_si.py "/Path/to/your/file"
```

**This is required python 3.6.x or later**

This piece of software has no warranty and I release this under GNU v3 license.
So feel free to take the idea or you can take this code to you project.

Thank you.
